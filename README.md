🧠 Chess Engine Integration
The backend uses the Stockfish engine for evaluating moves and responding to the user's input

Ensure Stockfish is properly set up and configured in the backend code

📌 Notes
Make sure your database is running and accessible

Ensure that CORS is configured if you deploy frontend and backend on different origins

Stockfish engine binary should be available and correctly invoked from backend
